# notes
A work-in-progress cross-platform open-source cloud-synchronized note-taking app. (Along the lines of OneNote)

This repository currently includes a prototype for Android. The full scope of the project includes a linux cloud server (probably dockerized), an Android app, a Windows app, and a Linux package.
